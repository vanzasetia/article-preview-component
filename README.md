## Overview

### Introduction

Welcome to the `README.md` of this repo! The purpose of creating this project is to increase my coding skill.

In this file I'm going to tell you everything, start from tools that I used, and much more.

That's it for the introduction and **happy reading!**

### The Challenge

The challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
- Navigate the component using assistive technology
